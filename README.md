# Password-Generator
This project is a Password Generator program built in Python that creates a strong and random password using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
It uses a for loop to generate each character of the password and if-else conditions to decide what type of character (uppercase, lowercase, digit, or symbol) should be added at each step.

⚙️ Working Principle:

The user specifies the desired password length.

The program runs a for loop for that many iterations.

Inside the loop:

The program uses if-elif-else conditions to randomly choose:

A lowercase letter (a–z)

An uppercase letter (A–Z)

A digit (0–9)

A special character (!, @, #, $, etc.)

Each chosen character is added to the password string.

Finally, the complete password is displayed.
